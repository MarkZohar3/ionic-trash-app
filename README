# Trash App
Mobile application which uses an interactive map to help the user
find and map waste areas. Besides determining the position of illegal dumping areas, the users can
also describe their observations and mark the area as clean. The app automatically runs hourly, daily
and weekly stats of individual contributions and provides a leaderboard with the most active users.
The app uses a three-level architecture that consists of an application, a server, and a database. The
latter is made of a cloud firestore and an authentication system. The cloud firestore stores the waste
areas and userâ€™s information. The authentication system handles the users session features, such as
registration, login and logout
